# App Development Process Document

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to create an Android app with login and registration functionality. The app utilizes SQLite for user data storage and includes custom notifications for various events. The primary programming languages used are Java for Android development, SQL for database operations, and XML for layout design.

## Development Tools:

- Android Studio: The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- SQLite Database: A lightweight, embedded database used for storing user information locally on the device.
- Java: The primary programming language for Android app development.
- XML: Used for defining the app's layout and appearance.

## Development Steps:

### 1. Project Setup:

1. **Create a New Android Project:**
   - Launch Android Studio and create a new Android project with an appropriate name.
   - Choose the target Android device and set up the project structure.

2. **Design User Interface:**
   - Design the login, registration, and main activity layouts using XML.
   - Include input fields for username, password, and other required information.
   - Implement buttons for login, registration, and logout.

### 2. Database Setup:

1. **Create Database Helper Class:**
   - Develop a `DatabaseHelper` class to manage database creation and version management.
   - Define the table structure for storing user information, including columns for username, password, etc.

2. **Implement User Data Source:**
   - Create a `UserDataSource` class to interact with the SQLite database.
   - Implement methods for user creation, retrieval, and other database operations.

### 3. Login and Registration Logic:

1. **Login Activity:**
   - Develop the `Login` activity where users can enter their credentials.
   - Implement logic to validate login information against the database.
   - Save login status and username in shared preferences upon successful login.

2. **Registration Activity:**
   - Create the `Register` activity for user registration.
   - Implement logic to store user information in the SQLite database.

### 4. Custom Notifications:

1. **NotificationHelper Class:**
   - Develop a `NotificationHelper` class to handle the display of custom notifications.
   - Customize the layout and appearance of notifications using XML.

2. **Show Notifications:**
   - Implement the display of notifications in relevant parts of the app.
   - Utilize custom notification layouts for specific events like first-time login.

### 5. MainActivity Logic:

1. **MainActivity:**
   - Develop the `MainActivity` class as the main screen after login.
   - Check the login status and redirect to the login screen if not logged in.
   - Display the logged-in user's information, including a custom notification if it's their first login.

### 6. Logout Logic:

1. **Logout Functionality:**
   - Implement a logout button in the `MainActivity`.
   - Display a confirmation dialog before logging out.
   - Clear login status and navigate back to the login screen.

## Testing:

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Conduct unit tests for critical components such as database operations, login validation, and notification display.
   - Ensure proper error handling and edge case testing.

2. **User Acceptance Testing:**
   - Test the app on different Android devices and screen sizes.
   - Validate user flows, including login, registration, and logout processes.

## Deployment:

1. **Prepare for Release:**
   - Optimize the app's performance and resolve any issues identified during testing.
   - Generate a signed APK for release.

2. **Distribution:**
   - Publish the app on the Google Play Store or any other desired distribution platform.

## Maintenance and Future Development:

1. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Monitor user feedback and address reported issues promptly.
   - Consider adding new features or enhancements based on user needs.

2. **Security Considerations:**
   - Regularly review and update security measures to protect user data.
   - Stay informed about potential security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

By following these development steps, the app should provide a seamless user experience with robust login functionality, secure data storage, and engaging custom notifications. Regular updates and improvements will ensure the app's longevity and user satisfaction.
